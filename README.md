Identify the type of Raisin using classification models using Machine learning 

The project is about the identify the types of the Raisins among the two types of Riasins which are grown in Turkey which is one of the world famous in Grapes grown 
There is much detailed information of the work on the proect in the project report attached along with the code file below 
But just to summarize the the overall work of the project 
I took the data set with 900 records among which some are belongs to Kaisemen Raisin and some belongs to Besni Raisin 
My data set is basically numerical data set and there are no much outliers in the data set so there is no much pre-processing work so i simply Scaled my data and then start applying the different models on the data set to predict the accuracies for each model 
The models which i used in my project are KNN,Bagging classifier(Decision tree),Multi layer perceptron(Neural networks),Logistic regression,Decision tree ,SVM, Ensemble learning turns out SVM accuracy is high compared with other models and rest other models not that bad compared with SVM there is very less reduction of the accuracies 
As mentioned above there is much details avaialable in the report attached along with code.
